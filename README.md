# Enigame Toolkit
A gathering of a few tools useful during [Enigame](https://www.enigame.com) puzzle hunts.

This project is purely **fanmade**.

## NOTE
This repository now contains only frontend of the application. The backend has been moved to [EnitoolkitDotNET](https://github.com/Ves5/EnitoolkitDotNET), together with remake and new additions in ASP.NET instead of Python. Old version is available in archive folder of backend repository.
